# Snake Animation in CSS Grid

This project demonstrates a snake-like animation moving through the gaps between images in a CSS Grid layout. It utilizes keyframe animations and CSS Grid properties to create a visually engaging effect.

## Features

- **CSS Grid Layout**: Images are arranged in a grid with gaps.
- **Snake Animation**: A circular element moves through the grid gaps.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Uses `@keyframes` for continuous movement.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Grid, Animations, Keyframes)

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```
